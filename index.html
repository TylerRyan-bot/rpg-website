                <h2> A Bit About me </h2>
                <p class="custom-style"> A few things about me. The very first RPG I played was called Baulder's Gate 2 for the PS2. I think what drew me in was the ability to do and be whatever you want. That initial experience completely shaped the gamer I am today. I have been playing video games since I was 8 years old.</p>

            <h2> What Makes an RPG? </h2>
            <h2>Essential Elements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>World-building</li>
                <li>Story-telling</li>

                <li>Strategic combat</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The essence of an RPG lies in its narrative-driven gameplay, where players embark on quests, make choices that affect the story's progression, and interact with other characters and the game world. RPGs often feature character development through experience points and leveling up, allowing players to enhance their skills and abilities over time. With a focus on exploration, strategic combat, and immersive storytelling, RPGs provide players with an engaging and often expansive gaming experience.</p>

            <h2> Storytelling and World-Building </h2>
            <p>RPGs excel in both storytelling and world-building, creating immersive experiences through intricate plotlines and well-crafted environments. Players navigate through detailed game worlds filled with unique lore, memorable characters, and meaningful choices that shape the narrative. The combination of engaging stories and expansive, believable worlds draws players in, making them feel like integral parts of epic sagas.</p>

            <h2 id="character-development"> Character Development </h2>
            <a href="#strategic-combat">Go to Strategic Combat</a>
            <p>One of the most captivating elements of RPGs is the depth of character development. Players often start with a basic character and, through various quests and challenges, enhance their abilities, acquire new skills, and collect powerful equipment. This gradual progression gives a sense of growth and accomplishment, as players can see their character evolve from a novice to a seasoned hero. The customization options available in RPGs allow players to create characters that reflect their personal playstyle, whether they prefer to be a formidable warrior, a cunning rogue, or a wise mage.</p>

            <h2 id="strategic-combat"> Strategic Combat </h2>
            <p>Combat in RPGs is not just about brute force; it requires strategic thinking and planning. Players must carefully consider their character's abilities, equipment, and tactics to overcome a variety of enemies and obstacles. Turn-based combat systems, real-time action, or a mix of both are commonly found in RPGs, each offering a different level of strategic depth. The challenge of mastering combat mechanics and developing effective strategies adds another layer of engagement to RPGs, making each battle a test of skill and ingenuity.</p>
